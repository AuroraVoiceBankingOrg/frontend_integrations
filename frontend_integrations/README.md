# frontend_integrations

This repository focuses on integrating various front-end platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop) with the AI voice assistant backends.
It includes:
- Mobile UIs (iOS, Android) to capture user voice/text input and display results.
- Web components (React) for browser-based interfaces.
- Desktop (Electron) integrations for standalone desktop apps.
- Banking and credit card widgets to show financial data returned from external_integrations.
- Language toggling, voice input buttons, security login forms, and UI themes.
- Configurations, testing environments, CI helpers, and example code for quick adaptation.

By examining these directories and files, developers can quickly integrate the assistant into various frontends, customize UI/UX, handle multilingual content, and ensure security and performance.
